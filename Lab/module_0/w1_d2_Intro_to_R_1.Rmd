# What is R?
.large[
R is a powerful programming language for statistics, data science, etc.

You can do all kinds of statistical analyses, from the most basic ones to artificial intelligence.

Using `sf` package, you can (almost) replace GIS applications, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.

It is completely free to use.

# What is R studio?
.large[
R-Studio is a code editor developed for R. 

R is a language, just like any other language (e.g., English, French etc). You can write R code in any text editor.

e.g., you can write your English report in Notepad, but people usually use MS Word because it provides convenient functions.

# Packages
.large[
Packages are extensions to R that provide various functions and datasets that the plain R does not have. 
]

###.center[It is like apps for your phone.]

.mid[
**Step 1**: You first need to install a package into your hard drive. Just like installing apps in your phone, you only need to do it once per computer.

**Step 2**: You need to load the package into your R session. This is like opening an app in your phone.

**Step 3**: Now the package is loaded. You can use functions in the package.
