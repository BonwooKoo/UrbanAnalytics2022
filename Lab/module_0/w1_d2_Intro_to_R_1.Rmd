# What is R?
.mid[R is a powerful programming language for statistics, data science, etc.

You can do all kinds of statistical analyses, from the most basic ones to artificial intelligence.

Using `sf` package, you can (almost) replace GIS applications, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.

It is completely free to use.]

---
# What is R?
.mid[
R makes communicating your data and findings easy through online platforms easy.

You can also create [dashboards](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/india-blood-banks.html), blog posts with interactive maps and charts.

# What is R studio?
.mid[
R-Studio is a code editor developed for R. 

R is a language, just like any other language (e.g., English, French etc). You can write R code in any text editor.

e.g., you can write your English report in Notepad, but people usually use MS Word because it provides convenient functions.

# Installation

.mid[
R language and R-Studio need to be installed separately.
]

  
.left-column[
###[Click to install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

<br><br>

###[Click to install R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

]

.right-column[
1.Choose your operation system (e.g., Windows, macOS, etc.). 

2.Choose base.

3.Click "Download R-4.2.1" for your OS.

4.Install using the downloaded file with all default options selected.
]




.right-column[
1.Choose **RStudio Desktop** (free version)

2.Choose your operation system and download installation file.

3.Install using the downloaded file with all default options selected.

# Packages
.mid[
Packages are extensions to R that provide various functions and datasets that the plain R does not have. 
]

###.center[It is like apps for your phone.]

.mid[
**Step 1**: You first need to install a package into your hard drive. Just like installing apps in your phone, you only need to do it once per computer.

**Step 2**: You need to load the package into your R session. This is like opening an app in your phone.

**Step 3**: Now the package is loaded. You can use functions in the package.
]

# Setting Environment

.mid[
When we start writing a R script, we usually call libraries and set the working directory (WD).

In R Markdown, WD is where the RMD file is located. This usually works fine. 

For a plain R script, WD is usually somewhere like *C:/Users/Bonwoo/Documents*.
]

.mid[.center[
**We need to use different strategies depending on <br> whether you are working on a RMarkdown or a plain R script.**
]]

.pull-left[
**On Plain R script**
```{r eval=F}
setwd("path-to-your-wd")
```
]

.pull-right[
**In R Markdown**
```{r eval=F}
knitr::opts_knit$set(
  roo.dir = "path-to-your-wd")
```
]

# Reading data

In urban analytics for planning, the file formats we usually deal with include (but not limited to) **.CSV**, **.SHP**, **.JSON**, and **.GEOJSON**.

We need different packages to import these data formats. 

Sample data: [CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BonwooKoo/UrbanAnalytics2022/main/Lab/module_0/testdata.csv), SHP(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BonwooKoo/UrbanAnalytics2022/main/Lab/module_0/testdata.geojson), [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BonwooKoo/UrbanAnalytics2022/main/Lab/module_0/testdata.json)


```{r eval=F}
# CSV files
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("file-name.csv") # or
df <- readr::read_csv("file-name.csv")

# SHP & GEOJSON files
df <- sf::st_read("file-name.shp")
df <- sf::st_read("file-name.geojson")

# JSON files
df <- jsonlite::fromJSON("file-name.json") %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

# Basic verbs of dplyr
Assuming tabular data (e.g., like an Excel file), there is a set of operations we routinely perform, such as filtering rows, creating new variables, etc.

The package `dplyr`, combined with the **pipe (%>%)**, makes this data wrangling very intuitive.

```{r, message=F}
my_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BonwooKoo/UrbanAnalytics2022/main/Lab/module_0/testdata.csv")
my_df %>% nice_table("200px")
```

---
# dplyr basics

#### select, filter, arrange, mutate, group_by + summarise

All verbs work similarly: <font size=2px, color='grey'>(Wickham & Grolemund (2016))</font>

* The first argument of the verbs is a data frame.
* The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame
* The result is a new data frame.

--

e.g., `filter()` picks observations (i.e., rows of a DF) by their values.

```{r}
filter(my_df, # specifies which data.frame
       COUNTY == "DeKalb County") %>%  # conditional statement  
  nice_table() # ignore this nice_table() for now.
```

---
# BTW, %>% is called the **pipe**.
.center[.mid[
It takes whatever is passed from **before** the pipe and 

inserts it as **the first argument** of the following function.
]]

```{r eval=F}
filter(my_df, COUNTY == "DeKalb County") %>%  
  nice_table("150px")
```

is equivalent to

```{r}
my_df %>% filter(COUNTY == "DeKalb County") %>% 
  nice_table("150px")
```

---
# Back to dplyr basics

.pull-left[
* **select()** can pick **variable(s)** by their names.

```{r}
my_df %>% 
  select(COUNTY,tot_age25) %>% #<<
  nice_table()
```
]

.pull-right[
* **arrange()** can reorder **rows**.
```{r}
my_df %>% 
  select(COUNTY,tot_age25) %>% 
  arrange(tot_age25) %>% #<<
  nice_table()
```

.center[
**Notice that %>% connects multiple dplyr verbs down the line.**

**This is why pipe is so useful!**
]
]

---
# dplyr basics

**mutate()** can create a new columns using existing columns.
```{r}
my_df %>% 
  mutate(pct_less_hs = less_hs / tot_age25) %>% #<<
  select(2:4, tot_age25, less_hs, pct_less_hs) %>% nice_table()
```

Notice that **select()** can take either variable names or the index of columns.

Because `2:4` in R is the same as `c(2,3,4)`, we select not only tot_age25, less_hs, and pct_less_hs, but also the second, third, and fourth columns **of the data table that were passed to select()**.

---
# dplyr basics
**group_by()** creates a grouping across observations (i.e., rows). <br> With the grouping, **summarise()** can do summarization (e.g., taking average) for each group.

As the return, we get data table with **the grouping variable** (i.e., COUNTY) and whatever we create in **summarise()** function.

```{r}
my_df %>% 
  group_by(COUNTY) %>% # creating grouping by county.  #<<
  summarise(avg.pop25 = mean(tot_age25), # mean for each county
            med.hinc = median(hinc)) %>% nice_table("160px")
```

In plain English, this code says "Take **my_df** and calculate the mean of **tot_age25** and the median of **hinc** for each county."
