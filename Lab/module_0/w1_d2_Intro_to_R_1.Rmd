# What is R?
.mid[R is a powerful programming language for statistics, data science, etc.

You can do all kinds of statistical analyses, from the most basic ones to artificial intelligence.

Using `sf` package, you can (almost) replace GIS applications, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.

It is completely free to use.]

# What is R?
.mid[
R makes communicating your data and findings easy through online platforms easy.

You can also create [dashboards](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/india-blood-banks.html), blog posts with interactive maps and charts.

# What is R studio?
.mid[
R-Studio is a code editor developed for R. 

R is a language, just like any other language (e.g., English, French etc). You can write R code in any text editor.

e.g., you can write your English report in Notepad, but people usually use MS Word because it provides convenient functions.

# Install

.mid[
R language and R-Studio need to be installed separately.

1.Choose your operation system (e.g., Windows, macOS, etc.). 

2.Choose base.

3.Click "Download R-4.2.1" for your OS.

4.Install using the downloaded file with all default options selected.

# Packages
.mid[
Packages are extensions to R that provide various functions and datasets that the plain R does not have. 
]

###.center[It is like apps for your phone.]

.mid[
**Step 1**: You first need to install a package into your hard drive. Just like installing apps in your phone, you only need to do it once per computer.

**Step 2**: You need to load the package into your R session. This is like opening an app in your phone.

**Step 3**: Now the package is loaded. You can use functions in the package.

# Setting Environment

.mid[
When we start writing a R script, we usually call libraries and set the working directory (WD).

In R Markdown, WD is where the RMD file is located. This usually works fine. 

For a plain R script, WD is usually somewhere like *C:/Users/Bonwoo/Documents*.
]

.mid[.center[
**We need to use different strategies depending on <br> whether you are working on a RMarkdown or a plain R script.**
]]

.pull-left[
**On Plain R script**
```{r eval=F}
setwd("path-to-your-wd")
```
]

.pull-right[
**In R Markdown**
```{r eval=F}
knitr::opts_knit$set(
  roo.dir = "path-to-your-wd")
```

# Reading data

In urban analytics for planning, the file formats we usually deal with include (but not limited to) **.CSV**, **.SHP**, **.JSON**, and **.GEOJSON**.

We need different packages to import these data formats. 

Sample data: [CSV](), SHP, JSON


```{r eval=F}
# CSV files
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("file-name.csv") # or
df <- read.csv("file-name.csv")

# SHP & GEOJSON files
library(sf)
df <- st_read("file-name.shp")
df <- st_read("file-name.geojson")

# JSON files
library(jsonlite)
df <- fromJSON("file-name.json") %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

# Basic verbs of dplyr
.mid[
Assuming tabular data (e.g., like an Excel file), there is a set of operations we routinely perform. 

The package `dplyr`, combined with the **pipe (%>%)**, makes this data wrangling very intuitive.
]

```{r}

```
