# Data for Urban Analytics

.mid[
**Big data is not just about size.** If the size was all that makes a data big, then there is nothing new about big data; we've had it for a long time. For example,

* National Decennial Census <br> <font size=5px, color="grey">(which technically covers the entire population; hundreds of millions)</font>
* Survey response for electoral predictions <br> 
  <font size=5px, color="grey">
    (e.g., The famous 2.4 million survey responses by Literary Digest in 1936, which, despite the size, miserably failed)
  </font>

# Characteristics of Big Data

.mid[
Kitchin (2014) details that big data can be characterized by: 
]

.mid[
* **Volume**, consisting of terabytes or petabytes of data;

* **Velocity**, being created in or near real-time;

* **Variety**, being structured and unstructured in nature;

And goes on to include:
]

* **Exhaustive** in scope, striving to capture entire populations or systems (n=all);

* fine-grained in **resolution**;

* **relational** in nature, containing common fields that can join different data sets;

* **flexible** (can add new fields easily) and **scaleability** (can expand in size rapidly).
